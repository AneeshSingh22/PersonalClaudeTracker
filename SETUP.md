# Dashboard — Setup Guide (fork → deploy in ~5 min)

This is a static dashboard (plain HTML/JS) that deploys on **Vercel** and syncs across your
devices with **Supabase**. WHOOP is an optional add-on.

---

## 1. Fork & deploy

1. **Fork** this repo to your GitHub.
2. Go to **vercel.com → Add New → Project → Import** your fork.
3. Framework Preset: **Other**. Root Directory: **`./`**. Build/output: leave blank (static).
4. **Deploy.** You'll get a URL like `https://your-app.vercel.app`.

The dashboard opens to a **password screen** — the default password is in
[`lock.js`](lock.js) (`var PASSWORD = "qwer"`). Change it to whatever you want.

---

## 2. Supabase (cross-device sync) — required for sync

Create a free project at **supabase.com**, then run **both** SQL blocks in
**SQL Editor → New query → Run**.

### SQL #1 — `app_state` (all dashboard sync)
```sql
create table if not exists public.app_state (
  key        text primary key,
  data       jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- The browser uses the ANON key, so allow it to read/write:
alter table public.app_state enable row level security;
create policy "anon full access app_state"
  on public.app_state for all
  to anon using (true) with check (true);

-- Instant cross-device updates:
alter publication supabase_realtime add table public.app_state;
```

### SQL #2 — progress-photo sync (Storage bucket)
Progress photos upload to a Supabase **Storage** bucket called `progress-photos` (only the
image URLs sync through `app_state`). Skip this if you don't need photos to sync across devices.
```sql
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('progress-photos', 'progress-photos', true)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

create policy "anon manage progress-photos"
  on storage.objects for all
  to anon
  using (bucket_id = 'progress-photos')
  with check (bucket_id = 'progress-photos');
```

### Connect YOUR Supabase — pick ONE way
Supabase → **Project Settings → API**. Copy the **Project URL** and the **anon / publishable** key.

**Way A — Vercel env vars (easiest, no code edits):**
In Vercel → **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | your Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | your anon / publishable key |

Redeploy. The app reads these automatically via `/api/config`.

**Way B — edit the files:**
Replace the old URL/key in these files:
- [`sync.js`](sync.js)
- [`topbar.js`](topbar.js)
- [`gym.html`](gym.html)

> ⚠️ Only the **anon** key (public) is used here. **Never** put the `service_role` key in code
> or in these env vars.

## 3. WHOOP (optional)

1. **developer.whoop.com** → create an app.
2. Set its **Redirect URI** to exactly: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/whoop-callback`
   (use your real Vercel domain — add every domain you'll open the site from).
3. Put your app's **Client ID** in [`health.html`](health.html) (`const CLIENT_ID = '...'`),
   and add these in Vercel → **Settings → Environment Variables**, then redeploy:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `WHOOP_CLIENT_ID` | your WHOOP app's Client ID |
| `WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET` | your WHOOP app's Client Secret (**secret**) |

4. Open the site at that exact domain → Health page → **Connect WHOOP**.

> The callback auto-detects the domain, so you do **not** need a `WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI` env var.

---

## 4. Apple Health (optional)

Steps, heart rate, HRV, sleep, VO2 max, etc. sync in automatically once a day via the
**Health Auto Export** iOS app's REST API automation — no server/OAuth setup on Apple's side,
since Apple doesn't offer a cloud API for Health data.

1. Buy **Health Auto Export** on the App Store (one-time purchase).
2. In the app, create a new **Automation → REST API** export.
3. **URL**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health-import` (your real Vercel domain).
4. **Method**: POST. **Format**: JSON.
5. Add a custom header: `x-api-key: <a secret you choose>`.
6. Pick a daily schedule, and select the metrics you want synced (steps, heart rate,
   HRV, resting heart rate, active energy, VO2 max, blood oxygen, respiratory rate,
   exercise time, flights climbed, sleep analysis — any subset works).
7. In Vercel → **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `HEALTH_IMPORT_KEY` | the same secret you put in the `x-api-key` header |

8. Redeploy, then run the automation once from the app to confirm it works — Health tab →
   **Apple Health** card should populate within a few seconds.

> This same app also has a "Connect MCP server" feature for live, on-device queries — useful
> for one-off historical backfills (ask Claude to do one), but it only works while your phone
> and computer share a WiFi network and the app is open, so it's not used for the live site.

## 5. Nova (AI mentor / gym coach) — optional

No setup or key in the repo. Each user **pastes their own Anthropic API key** on the
**Nova** tile; it's stored only in their browser and sent straight to Anthropic. Get a key at
console.anthropic.com.

## TL;DR
1. Fork → import to Vercel → deploy.
2. New Supabase → run the **SQL** above → paste your **URL + anon key** into `sync.js`,
   `topbar.js`, `gym.html`.
3. (Optional) WHOOP: Client ID in `health.html` + the two env vars in Vercel.
4. (Optional) Apple Health: Health Auto Export automation → `HEALTH_IMPORT_KEY` env var in Vercel.
5. Change the password in `lock.js`. Done.
